                <h2>Why We Chose Akrotiri</h2>
                <p>
                    Akrotiri is not a place we chose on a map. It is a philosophy we chose to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long before saffron entered global trade, it was gathered with intention—harvested by hand, valued for its rarity, and used with reverence in art, healing, and ritual. Akrotiri represents that way of thinking. A respect for time, for process, and for
                    the quiet discipline required to preserve purity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose the name Akrotiri because it reminds us that what endures is never rushed. It is protected, repeated carefully, and allowed to mature at its own pace.
                </p>

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>
                    We are a small collective of growers, researchers, and custodians brought together by a shared belief: saffron deserves patience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our journey began with a simple question—what would saffron become if quality was never compromised? That question led us toward careful cultivation, selective harvesting, and an uncompromising commitment to purity. We chose saffron not because it is
                    rare, but because it demands attention. We chose patience because excellence cannot be hurried.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Akrotiri exists for those who understand that true quality is not claimed through words, but earned through consistent, thoughtful practice.

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Our Ethics</h2>
                <p>
                    At Akrotiri, ethics are not written as policies. They are lived as beliefs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We care for cultivation by respecting natural cycles rather than accelerating them. We care for people by honouring the knowledge, skill, and hands behind every harvest. We care for science by using precision only where it protects integrity and consistency.
                    And we care for the consumer by offering saffron exactly as it is—pure, unaltered, and honest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our responsibility is not to scale quickly or speak loudly, but to remain worthy of trust, year after year.
                </p>

        <!-- Founder Note -->
        <section class="founder-note">
            <p>
                We did not begin Akrotiri in pursuit of scale or speed, but in pursuit of meaning. In the stillness of dawns and the turning of seasons, we learned that saffron yields only to patience and respect. Every decision we make is measured against that truth. If it does not preserve the integrity of the harvest, we do not proceed. Time is not our obstacle — it is our teacher.

                                Saffron is never hurried. Flowers are harvested only at first bloom, before the sun rises high, when aroma, colour, and potency are at their peak. Each stigma is separated by hand, because no machine understands timing the way human attention does.

                                Not every harvest earns the name Akrotiri. Threads that fail to meet our internal benchmarks for colour depth, aroma intensity, and structural integrity are quietly set aside. Scarcity is not manufactured—it is the natural outcome of discipline.

                                Drying and storage are treated as acts of preservation, not production. Temperature, light, and time are carefully balanced to protect volatile compounds, ensuring that flavour and fragrance mature rather than fade.
